            <p>
                I recently earned a certificate in full stack web develop through UNC Charlotte. It introduced and made me well a
                acquainted with JavaScript, Node.js, mySQL, Restful APIs, MongoDB, Mongoose and other languages. 
                I found my strangth lies in back-end development, which I have come to thoroughly enjoy. I am currently
                working on a certificate that focuses on back-end development through Google. Previously I earned a B.A. 
                inanthopolgy and an M.S. in Management. Throughout my education it's become clear that as seekers we're 
                rarely satisfaid with knowledge we always strive for a better understanding or new material. This is a large reason 
                why I decided to shift gears and focus on the tech industry - an ever growing industry with an ever growing wealth 
                of knowledge.
